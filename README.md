# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and visualize patterns that influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset contains demographic and travel information of passengers aboard the Titanic. This EDA focuses on identifying survival trends based on factors such as:

- Gender
- Passenger class
- Age
- Fare
- Family relationships onboard (SibSp & Parch)

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Understand the structure and composition of the dataset
- Handle missing values and detect outliers
- Visualize the distribution of numerical and categorical features
- Identify correlations between features
- Analyze how different factors impacted survival rates

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries

- *Python 3*
- *Pandas* – data manipulation
- *NumPy* – numerical operations
- *Matplotlib* – static visualizations
- *Seaborn* – statistical visualizations
- *Plotly* – interactive charts

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive compared to those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- Higher fare amounts are correlated with increased chances of survival.
- There are missing values in the Age and Cabin columns.
- The dataset shows some skewness and outliers in Fare and Age.
